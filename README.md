# linear-regression-lab

A project made for the linear algebra and geometry course during the first year of the undergraduate degree.

Includes the following:
- Least Squares Method application; searching for polynomial function, that best approximates the unknown dependence.
- Linear regression; analysis of data on apartments in Moscow.
- Complicating the model from the previous point so it gives more than 20% less root mean square error on the test sample
- Regularization applied to the first task about Least Squares Method.
